    overview: "From the outer reaches of space to the small-town streets of suburbia, the hunt comes home. Now, the universeâ€™s most lethal hunters are stronger, smarter and deadlier than ever before, having genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species. When a young boy accidentally triggers their return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race.",
